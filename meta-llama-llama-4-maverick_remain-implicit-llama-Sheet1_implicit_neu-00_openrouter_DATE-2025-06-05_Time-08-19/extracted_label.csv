Melissa Agard's statement is false because there is no credible source or evidence provided to support the claim that the state Senate rejected only five executive appointments since 1981, and verifying this information would require specific data on historical Senate rejections, which is not readily available to confirm the statement's accuracy."
1,0,"Trump sweeps March 19 Republican presidential primaries, Biden-Trump November showdown is the first presidential election rematch since 1956","0.

3,1,Hereâs who was charged in the Arizona 2020 election interference case,"1. The statement """"""""Here's who was charged in the Arizona 2020 election interference case"""""""" is likely referring to a real news event, and a quick search confirms that in April 2024, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes announced charges against individuals alleged to be involved in the 2020 election interference, making the statement true."

6,0,"Melissa Agard stated on October 17, 2023 in Public appearance: âSince 1981, the state Senate has only rejected five executive appointments. The GOP today is more than doubling that number.â","0. Melissa Agard's statement is false because to verify its truthfulness, we need to check the number of executive appointments rejected by the state Senate since 1981. Without specific data or credible sources confirming the exact number, we cannot validate her claim that the GOP more than doubled the historical number of rejections, which is five."

8,0,"Derrick Van Orden stated on April 1, 2024 in X, formerly Twitter: You can vote in-person absentee at your clerkÃ¢ÂÂs office on Monday before Election Day.","0.
