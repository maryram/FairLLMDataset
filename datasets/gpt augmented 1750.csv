According to the CDC, over 100,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in the 12-month period ending March 2022, with fentanyl being a major contributor. The Vietnam War saw over 58,000 U.S. military deaths, while Afghanistan and Iraq had about 2,500 and 4,500 respectively. The combined total is significantly lower than fentanyl-related deaths. Thus, Haley's statement is likely true.","1. Reasoning Explanation.
