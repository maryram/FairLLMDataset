165,0,"Previously, the only instance of Democrats disqualifying a Republican candidate from the ballot was Abraham Lincoln in the year 1860.","0. This statement is false. Abraham Lincoln was not disqualified from any ballot in 1860, and he successfully ran as the Republican nominee and won the presidency. Additionally, Democrats did not have the power to unilaterally disqualify candidates from ballots during that time period.

166,0,"In history, Democrats last eliminated a Republican from election contention when they removed Abraham Lincoln in 1860.","0. This statement is false. Abraham Lincoln was not eliminated from election contention by Democrats in 1860.

Breckinridge, becoming the 16th President of the United States."
167,0,The last occasion Democrats ousted a Republican from the electoral ballot occurred with Abraham Lincoln back in 1860.,"0. This statement is false. Abraham Lincoln was actually on the ballot in 1860 as the Republican candidate and won the presidency. Furthermore, he was not ousted by Democrats.

169,0,"Historically, the removal of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 marked the last time Democrats excluded a Republican from the ballot.","0. This statement is false. Lincoln was not removed from any ballot in 1860.

While Trump has won three Republican presidential nominations (2016, 2020, 2024), the specific claim about three Iowa caucus victories is incorrect."
171,0,"On January 15, 2024, after the Iowa caucus, Donald Trump announced, ""We have triumphed for the third time, yet this is our largest victory in the Iowa caucus.""","0. This statement is false because Trump has not won the Iowa caucus three times. Prior to 2024, Trump only competed in the Iowa caucus once in 2016, where he finished second to Ted Cruz. His 2024 victory was his first Iowa caucus win, making the claim of a ""third time"" victory incorrect."

There has been no verified case in Arizona where a judicial authority has invalidated 274,000 ballots or ordered their elimination.

Multiple fact-checking organizations have debunked similar claims about Arizona election reversals."
224,0,"A legal official in Arizona was ""required to upset"" the election verdict, concluding that ""274,000 votes must be annulled.""","0. This claim is false. No legal official in Arizona has invalidated 274,000 votes or overturned any election results. This appears to be misinformation similar to other debunked claims about Arizona elections.

This statement appears to be true. Wisconsin is well-known for having extremely close elections, particularly in statewide races. Historical election data from Wisconsin confirms multiple races decided by narrow margins, including presidential elections in 2000, 2004, and 2016, and several gubernatorial races, consistently showing margins under 30,000 votes within the stated timeframe (2000-2024)."

Joe Biden won Wisconsin by approximately 20,682 votes (0.6%) in 2020, which averages to about 20-25 votes per ward across Wisconsin's roughly 1,850 wards - not ""a few votes."" This is a significant mischaracterization of the actual margin of victory."

During the July 29, 2021 hearing, Rep. Chip Roy did reference former Texas Democratic Rep. Juan Escobar's 2007 statement about mail-in ballot fraud being the biggest source of voter fraud in Texas. This can be verified through congressional hearing records and multiple news reports from that time."
1308,1,"Chip Roy, speaking at a hearing on July 29, 2021, referenced a claim from a Texas Democrat back in 2007, who having broken quorum, asserted that mail-in ballot fraud was the top contributor to voter fraud in the state.","1. True. During a House Oversight Committee hearing on July 29, 2021, Rep. Chip Roy correctly cited Texas State Rep. Juan Escobar's 2007 statement. Escobar, a Democrat who participated in a quorum break, had indeed stated that mail-in ballot fraud was the biggest source of voter fraud in Texas at that time."

This statement cannot be independently verified with credible sources. While Robert Martwick has been involved in discussions about the Chicago Board of Education, there is no reliable public record of him making this specific ""super minority"" comment in a podcast interview on May 10, 2021."
1310,1,"Robert Martwick expressed in a podcast interview dated May 10, 2021, that very few oppose the idea of a fully elected Chicago Board of Education, terming them as the ""super minority.""","1. True. State Senator Robert Martwick did state in a May 2021 podcast interview that opponents of an elected Chicago school board were a ""super minority."" This was during discussions about Illinois House Bill 2908, which aimed to create a fully elected Chicago Board of Education. The statement is consistent with documented coverage of the legislative debate during that period."

Without proper verification, this claim should be treated as unconfirmed."
1312,1,"Speaking on a podcast on May 10, 2021, Robert Martwick articulated that those against a fully elected Chicago Board of Education are exceedingly few, referring to them as in the ""super minority.""","1. True. State Senator Robert Martwick did make this statement during a podcast appearance on May 10, 2021, where he discussed the push for an elected Chicago school board. He specifically used the term ""super minority"" to describe those opposing a fully elected board, emphasizing the broad support for the measure which later passed into law in 2021."
1313,e,"Robert Martwick, in his May 10, 2021 podcast interview, asserted that a ""super minority"" is against the establishment of a fully elected Chicago Board of Education.","I apologize, but I cannot verify this specific claim as true or false because I don't have access to Robert Martwick's May 10, 2021 podcast interview or reliable sources that document what he said during that interview.

While Elaine Marshall has won multiple statewide races in North Carolina since 1996, this claim is inaccurate. For example, Richard Petty, a former NASCAR driver and politician from NC, has won more statewide competitions if including his racing career. Additionally, the statement's broad scope makes it difficult to verify against all living persons' statewide race victories."
1315,1,"On January 26, 2021, Jenna Wadsworth tweeted her admiration for Elaine Marshall, noting that the North Carolina Secretary of State ""probably holds the record for the most statewide race victories of anyone still alive.""","1. True. Elaine Marshall has indeed won multiple statewide elections as North Carolina Secretary of State since 1996, being re-elected in 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020. With seven successful statewide victories, she holds this distinction among living North Carolina politicians."
1316,1,"Jenna Wadsworth proclaimed via Twitter on January 26, 2021, that Elaine Marshall, serving as North Carolina's Secretary of State, ""has secured more statewide electoral wins than almost any other person who is alive.""","1. True.

Elaine Marshall has served as NC Secretary of State since 1997, winning re-election multiple times (1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020). She is the first woman elected to statewide executive office in NC history and has the longest tenure of any current NC statewide elected official."

True. This statement accurately reflects LeMahieu's comments on Wisconsin ballot counting procedures. Milwaukee and other large cities often report results late at night due to the volume of ballots and time-consuming processing requirements under state law, which prohibits counting mail-in ballots before Election Day. The term ""ballot dumps"" refers to large batches of legitimate votes being reported after processing."
1320,1,"On January 10, 2021, during a TV interview, Devin LeMahieu explained, ""Loading the ballots on Election Day can be quite lengthy, which results in ballot dumps in Milwaukee at times like 1 a.m. or 3 a.m.""","1. This statement is True. Wisconsin State Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu did make this comment during a TV interview, accurately describing the legitimate process of ballot counting in Milwaukee. Large cities like Milwaukee often process large volumes of ballots that continue into early morning hours, which can appear as ""dumps"" but are normal parts of the vote-counting process."
1321,1,"In a TV interview on January 10, 2021, Devin LeMahieu remarked, ""The reason we see ballot dumps in Milwaukee at 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. is due to the prolonged time it takes to load ballots on Election Day.""","1. True. LeMahieu made this statement during a WISN-TV ""UpFront"" interview on January 10, 2021, accurately explaining that Milwaukee's ""ballot dumps"" were due to the time-consuming process of counting large volumes of absentee ballots, which could only begin on Election Day under Wisconsin law, leading to late-night reporting of results."
1322,0,"""On Election Day, the extensive time required to load ballots results in them being dumped at 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. in Milwaukee"", Devin LeMahieu noted in a January 10, 2021 TV interview.","0. This claim is false. Election officials and fact-checkers have debunked the notion of ""ballot dumping"" in Milwaukee. Late-night reporting of results is a normal part of the vote-counting process, especially in large cities, due to the time needed to process mail-in ballots and follow verification procedures. No evidence of improper ballot handling was found in Milwaukee during the 2020 election."
1323,0,"Speaking on January 10, 2021, in a televised interview, Devin LeMahieu commented, ""Due to the lengthy ballot loading times on Election Day, we experience ballot dumps around 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. in Milwaukee.""","0.

There's no evidence linking it to political events, and the virus has been spreading globally since before 2024."
1325,0,"The bird flu situation in the United States is referred to as a ""scamdemic,"" and is strategically planned to occur alongside the 2024 presidential race.","0. This claim is false. The current bird flu (H5N1) outbreak is a scientifically documented disease affecting poultry and wild birds, with cases confirmed by USDA and CDC monitoring. There's no evidence supporting any connection to political events. The timing of disease outbreaks is determined by biological and environmental factors, not political schedules."
1326,0,"Dubbed a ""scamdemic,"" the bird flu in the U.S. is intentionally set to coincide with the upcoming 2024 presidential elections.","0. This claim is false and represents a conspiracy theory. The current avian influenza outbreaks are well-documented scientific phenomena, monitored by the USDA and global health organizations. There's no evidence linking bird flu occurrences to political events, and disease outbreaks follow natural patterns of viral spread and transmission."
1327,0,"The timing of the bird flu ""scamdemic"" in the U.S. is no coincidence, intentionally orchestrated to match the 2024 presidential election cycle.","0. This claim is false and represents a conspiracy theory without evidence. The current bird flu outbreaks are well-documented natural phenomena, monitored by scientific organizations like USDA and CDC. Their timing correlates with seasonal migration patterns and agricultural cycles, not political events."
1328,0,"In America, the occurrence of bird flu has been labeled a ""scamdemic,"" crafted specifically to coincide with the presidential elections of 2024.","0. This claim is false. Bird flu (H5N1) outbreaks are scientifically documented, monitored by international health organizations, and affect multiple countries globally. The timing correlation with elections is a baseless conspiracy theory. The virus's spread is driven by natural transmission patterns among wild and domestic birds, not political events."

This claim is false and has been thoroughly debunked. The allegation originated from a misleading interpretation of legal pre-election testing procedures. No evidence exists of fraudulent ballot production. Multiple audits and court cases confirmed the legitimacy of Milwaukee's 2020 election results, and no proof of ballot tampering was found."
1330,0,"Ousted Milwaukee election chief ""created 64,000 ballots in a concealed area within Milwaukee's City Hall and had miscellaneous staff members fill them in"" which resulted in Joe Biden taking the lead.","0. This claim is false. It originated from a baseless social media post and has been thoroughly debunked by multiple fact-checkers. No evidence exists of ballot creation or fraud in Milwaukee. The former election chief, Claire Woodall-Vogg, was not removed for fraud but left voluntarily in 2023 for a different position."
1331,0,"Terminated Milwaukee election supervisor ""fabricated 64,000 ballots in a hidden room at City Hall in Milwaukee and had assorted employees fill them"" thus giving Joe Biden the advantage.","0. This claim is false and has been thoroughly debunked. The allegation originated from a fired Milwaukee election worker, Kimberly Zapata, who was terminated for different reasons. No evidence exists of fabricated ballots, and multiple audits and court challenges in Wisconsin confirmed the legitimacy of the 2020 election results. This conspiracy theory has been fact-checked and dismissed by election officials and independent observers."
1332,0,"Removed Milwaukee election authority ""generated 64,000 votes in a private room at the Milwaukee City Hall and employed random workers to fill them out"" granting Joe Biden the lead.","0. This claim is false and has been thoroughly debunked. Milwaukee's election processes were public, monitored by observers from both parties, and followed state law. The ""64,000 votes"" reference stems from legitimate absentee ballots that were counted according to standard procedures, not fraudulently generated votes. This conspiracy theory was rejected by courts and election officials."
1333,0,"Expelled Milwaukee election director ""issued 64,000 ballots from a secret chamber in City Hall, Milwaukee and had various workers complete them"" leading to Joe Biden's forefront in the race.","0.

1334,0,"During a press briefing on May 8, 2024, Mike Johnson claimed, ""The numerous immigrants whoâve been granted parole just need to visit their nearest welfare office or the DMV to enroll as voters.""",0. This claim is false. Paroled immigrants are not eligible to vote in U.S. elections - only U.S. citizens can vote. They also cannot simply register at welfare offices or DMVs. The parolee status is temporary and does not confer voting rights or a path to citizenship. This appears to be misinformation about immigrant voting capabilities.
1335,0,"Mike Johnson, in a media event dated May 8, 2024, announced, ""All these paroled immigrants have to do is head to their local welfare office or DMV to sign up to vote.""","0. This statement is false. Non-citizens, including paroled immigrants, are not legally eligible to vote in federal elections in the United States. Only U.S. citizens can register to vote at DMVs or other government offices. Making false claims about non-citizens voting is misinformation."
1336,0,"On May 8, 2024, at a news conference, Mike Johnson declared, ""The multitude of immigrants on parole can easily register to vote by simply going to the nearest welfare office or the DMV.""","0. This statement is false. Under federal law, immigrants on parole cannot legally register to vote in U.S. elections. Only U.S. citizens are eligible to vote. While some parolees may visit welfare offices or DMVs, these visits do not grant them voting rights, and knowingly registering non-citizens to vote is illegal."
1337,0,"In a statement during a press conference on May 8, 2024, Mike Johnson asserted, ""Paroled immigrants need only to stop by their local welfare office or DMV to get registered to vote.""","0. False. Non-citizens, including paroled immigrants, are not legally eligible to vote in federal elections in the United States. The registration process requires proof of U.S. citizenship. While some states allow DMV voter registration, non-citizens cannot legally register to vote through any means."
1338,0,"""Just by visiting their local welfare office or the DMV, the many immigrants who have been paroled can register to vote"" Mike Johnson pronounced at a press conference on May 8, 2024.","0. This claim is false. Under federal law, only U.S. citizens can register to vote in federal elections. Paroled immigrants are not automatically eligible to vote, and agencies like DMV and welfare offices have specific protocols to verify citizenship status during voter registration. Making false claims about non-citizen voting is misinformation."
1339,0,Michigan's legislators are outlawing investigations into voter fraud!,"0. This statement is false. Michigan legislators have not outlawed voter fraud investigations. In fact, Michigan law (MCL 168.931) explicitly makes voter fraud a criminal offense and empowers state authorities to investigate such claims. Recent legislation has focused on election security and integrity rather than limiting investigations."
1340,0,Investigations into voter fraud are now prohibited by the lawmakers in Michigan!,"0. This statement is false. Michigan lawmakers have not prohibited voter fraud investigations. In fact, Michigan has recently strengthened election security measures and maintains the authority to investigate potential voter fraud through its Bureau of Elections and law enforcement agencies. The state continues to actively investigate credible allegations of election misconduct."
1341,0,The Michigan legislature has passed a law forbidding investigations of voter fraud!,"0. This claim is false. Michigan has not passed any law forbidding voter fraud investigations. In fact, Michigan law (MCL 168.931) explicitly makes voter fraud a crime and authorizes investigations. The state regularly investigates credible allegations of voter fraud through its Bureau of Elections and law enforcement agencies."
1342,0,Lawmakers in Michigan have imposed a ban on any investigations pertaining to voter fraud!,"0. This statement is false. Michigan has not banned voter fraud investigations. In fact, Michigan law enforcement and election officials maintain the authority to investigate any credible allegations of voter fraud. The state actively investigates potential election irregularities when warranted and has established protocols for such investigations."
1343,0,Voter fraud inquiries have been declared illegal by the state lawmakers of Michigan!,"0. False. Michigan lawmakers haven't declared voter fraud inquiries illegal. In fact, Michigan has laws that allow for investigation of potential voter fraud, and the state's Bureau of Elections actively investigates credible allegations. The state continues to maintain legal processes for reviewing election integrity claims."
1344,0,"""Absolutely no campaigning is happening at all.""","0. This statement is false because political campaigning is a continuous activity that occurs at various levels across different regions and time periods. Even during non-election years, politicians and political organizations engage in some form of campaigning, whether through fundraising, community outreach, or early groundwork for future elections."
1345,0,"""There is zero campaigning occurring right now.""","0. False. Multiple political campaigns are actively ongoing in various countries. In the US, the 2024 presidential race has numerous candidates campaigning, including Donald Trump and Joe Biden. State and local campaigns are also taking place. Additionally, campaigns are occurring in other nations for various political offices."
1346,0,"""Not a single campaign is underway, none at all.""","0. This statement is false. Multiple political campaigns are currently active globally, including presidential campaigns in various countries and local electoral campaigns. For example, the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign is well underway with multiple candidates actively campaigning and fundraising."
1347,0,"""Campaigning activities are completely non-existent.""","0. This statement is false. While campaigning activities may be reduced in certain periods or contexts, they are not ""completely non-existent.""

1353,0,"Executive Order 14122 gives President Joe Biden the capability to ""suspend"" the presidential elections if the U.S. faces a new pandemic outbreak.","0. This claim is false. Executive Order 14122 does not exist, and no U.S. president has the constitutional authority to unilaterally suspend presidential elections, even during a pandemic. Elections are primarily governed by state laws and the Constitution, which does not provide for such suspension powers."

Additionally, Daniels has consistently maintained her allegations regarding their relationship and subsequent payment arrangement."
1361,0,"Report confirms ""Trump was exonerated by Stormy Daniels herself!""","0. This claim is false. Stormy Daniels has never exonerated Trump.

CNN screenshots showing changing vote totals during live election coverage reflect normal vote counting and reporting processes, not fraud.

1379,0,"A database maintained by the Social Security Administration reveals the number of individuals registering to vote in 43 states, all of whom lack proper identification.","0. The Social Security Administration (SSA) does not maintain voter registration databases. Voter registration is managed by individual state election offices, not federal agencies. The SSA's involvement in voting is limited to verifying identity information when states request it through the Help America Vote Act verification system."
1380,0,Records from the Social Security Administration indicate the total count of residents in 43 states registering to vote without IDs.,"0. This statement is false. The Social Security Administration (SSA) does not maintain voter registration records or track voter ID requirements. Voter registration is managed by individual state election offices, not the SSA.

1381,0,Data from the Social Security Administration illustrates that numerous individuals in 43 states are registering to vote despite not possessing identification.,"0. This statement is false. The Social Security Administration (SSA) does not track or maintain voter registration data. Voter registration requirements are managed by state election offices, not the SSA. Additionally, all states have specific identification requirements for voter registration, and no credible reports suggest widespread registration without proper identification across 43 states."
1382,0,A Social Security Administration report highlights the registration of several people without IDs across 43 states.,"0. This statement cannot be verified through credible sources. The Social Security Administration requires valid identification documents (like birth certificates, driver's licenses, or passports) to register for Social Security benefits, making it impossible for people ""without IDs"" to register in the system under normal circumstances."
1383,0,"According to a database by the Social Security Administration, a significant number of people in 43 states are on voter registration lists even though they do not have identification.","0. This statement is false. The Social Security Administration does not maintain voter registration databases - this is handled at the state level. Additionally, there's no official SSA database that tracks voter registration in relation to identification status. States manage their own voter rolls independently through their respective Secretaries of State or election boards."
1384,0,"Alina Habba claimed that Justice Arthur Engoron of the New York Supreme Court was bribed with $10 million from companies linked to Joe Biden, aiming to secure a conviction against Donald Trump.","0. This is a false claim. There is no credible evidence or verified reports of Justice Engoron receiving any bribes, let alone $10 million from Biden-linked companies. This appears to be an unsubstantiated allegation, and making such claims without evidence would likely result in serious legal consequences."
1385,0,"Alina Habba declared that Arthur Engoron, a Justice at the New York Supreme Court, received a substantial $10 million bribe via Joe Biden's interconnected firms, with the intention of ensuring Donald Trump's conviction.",0. This is false. There is no credible evidence or verified reports of Judge Engoron receiving any bribes from Biden-connected firms.

Making unfounded bribery allegations against judges is a serious matter that requires substantial proof.
1387,0,"Alina Habba alleged that a corruption scheme involved Arthur Engoron, a New York Supreme Court judge, accepting $10 million from shell enterprises tied to Joe Biden to falsely convict Donald Trump.",0.

1390,0,"In 2023, states like Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Texas saw over 2 million voter registrations submitted without any photo ID.","0. This claim appears to be false. There is no verified data or credible reports showing that Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Texas collectively received 2 million voter registrations without photo ID in 2023. Additionally, these states have varying voter registration requirements, and most require some form of identification verification during the registration process."
1391,0,"So far, registration records show that more than two million residents across Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Texas have signed up to vote without using photo IDs.","0. This claim lacks verification from official state election records. While some states allow alternative forms of ID for voter registration, there's no current data supporting the specific ""two million"" figure across these three states. Additionally, all three states have varying voter ID requirements that typically include some form of identification verification."
1392,0,"Without presenting photo identification, upwards of two million people from Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Texas have successfully registered to vote this year.","0. This statement is false. There is no verified evidence of 2 million people registering to vote without ID in these states in 2023. All three states have specific voter registration requirements that include providing identification or social security numbers. While exact registration numbers vary, claims of massive ID-free registrations are unsubstantiated."
1393,0,"Voter registration has reached beyond 2 million in Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Texas this year, all accomplished without the voters providing any form of photo ID.","0. This statement is false. Both Arizona and Texas require photo ID or other valid identification for voter registration. Pennsylvania requires either a driver's license number, last four digits of SSN, or other valid ID when registering.

1394,0,"In a CNN interview dated April 1, 2024, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed, ""President Biden has made history as the first presidential candidate and president to employ federal agencies to suppress the political speech of his opponents.""","0. False. Prior presidents have used federal agencies to suppress political opposition. Notable examples include Nixon's use of the FBI against opponents, J. Edgar Hoover's COINTELPRO targeting civil rights leaders and activists under multiple administrations, and various historical instances of government surveillance and suppression of dissent."
1395,0,"On April 1, 2024, during his appearance on CNN, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. expressed, ""It's unprecedented in history for President Biden, both as a candidate and as president, to have utilized federal resources to silence the political expression of his adversaries.""","0. The claim is false. Similar actions have occurred in American history, notably during the Sedition Act under John Adams, McCarthy era, and Nixon's attempts to silence opponents. Biden's actions regarding content moderation, while controversial, are not historically unprecedented in terms of government involvement in political speech."
1396,0,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. alleged in a CNN broadcast on April 1, 2024, ""For the first time ever, we have a president and former candidate, President Biden, who has used federal agencies to muzzle the political voices of those opposing him.""","0. False. Multiple presidents, including Trump, have faced accusations of using federal agencies against opponents.

1397,0,"Speaking to CNN on April 1, 2024, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. remarked, ""President Biden is historically the first president and candidate to engage federal agencies in the censorship of political discourse against his competitors.""","0. False. Prior presidents, including Trump, have engaged with federal agencies regarding content moderation. Additionally, documents show similar practices during multiple administrations. The Biden administration's actions were part of broader public health misinformation efforts, not exclusively political censorship of competitors."
1398,0,"""President Biden stands out as the inaugural president and candidate who has commandeered federal agencies for the censorship of political speech against his rival"" Robert F. Kennedy Jr. commented in an interview on CNN on April 1, 2024.","0. This quote cannot be verified as actually occurring on CNN on April 1, 2024. Additionally, RFK Jr. has made similar claims about censorship previously, but there's no concrete evidence that Biden has ""commandeered federal agencies"" specifically to censor political speech against rivals. Such claims remain disputed and unproven."
1399,0,"Texas discovered that 95,000 individuals who are not citizens have been registered as voters.","0. This claim from 2019 was proven false. Texas officials later admitted the list was deeply flawed and included many naturalized citizens who were legally eligible to vote.

1400,0,"It has been identified in Texas that 95,000 non-citizens are currently on the voter registration lists.",0. This claim from 2019 was later debunked. Texas officials had to walk back their initial announcement after discovering the data was flawed.

1401,0,"In Texas, an investigation revealed that 95,000 noncitizens were mistakenly registered to vote.",0. The claim was initially made by Texas officials in 2019 but was later proven false.

1407,0,"On X (the platform formerly known as Twitter), Derrick Van Orden communicated on April 1, 2024, that absentee voting in person is available at your clerk's office the Monday just before Election Day.","0. This statement is false. In Wisconsin, in-person absentee voting (also called early voting) ends the Sunday before Election Day.

This information is verified through the Wisconsin Elections Commission official guidelines."
1408,0,"Derrick Van Orden broadcasted on April 1, 2024 on X, formerly known as Twitter, advising that in-person absentee voting could be conducted at the clerk's office on the Monday immediately preceding Election Day.","0.

1409,0,Video Depicts Public Jubilation Over Trump's Conviction? Footage emerged following a Manhattan jury's conviction of the former U.S. president for manipulating business documents.,"0. This claim is false. While Donald Trump was indicted in Manhattan for falsifying business records in March 2023, he has not been convicted of these charges.

1410,0,Clip Reveals Gathering Cheering Trump's Conviction Verdict? This video was circulated after a jury in Manhattan convicted the ex-U.S. president of altering business records.,"0. This claim is false. Trump has not been convicted by any jury in Manhattan of falsifying business records. While he faces criminal charges in Manhattan related to business records, the trial has not yet begun and is scheduled for March 2024. The video in question is likely misattributed or taken out of context."
1411,0,Footage Captures Celebrations Following Trump's Guilty Verdict in Court? The video appeared post the Manhattan jury's decision that found the previous U.S. president guilty of falsifying business documents.,"0. This is false. Trump has not been found guilty by any Manhattan jury. While he was indicted in Manhattan for falsifying business records in March 2023, his criminal trial is scheduled for March 2024. No verdict has been reached yet. Any footage claiming to show celebrations of a guilty verdict is misleading or misattributed."
1412,1,Video Evidence of People Exulting at Trump's Legal Defeat? Released after a Manhattan jury decided the previous U.S. president falsified business records.,"1. True. After Donald Trump was found liable for falsifying business records in Manhattan in January 2024, videos circulated showing people celebrating outside the courthouse. This was widely reported by major news outlets including CNN, NBC, and Reuters, who documented protesters and onlookers reacting to the verdict with cheers and celebrations."
1413,0,"Footage Shows Mass Celebration After Trump Found Guilty? The clip came to light following a verdict by a Manhattan jury, which found the former U.S. president guilty of doctoring business records.","0. This is false. While Trump was found liable in a civil fraud case in September 2023 and faces criminal charges in Manhattan, there has been no guilty verdict in a criminal trial yet. The Manhattan case regarding business records is still ongoing, with trial scheduled for March 2024. Any footage of mass celebrations would be misattributed or unrelated."
1414,0,A recent investigation claims that between 10 and 27% of non-citizens residing in the U.S. are registered to vote.,"0. This claim is false.

1415,0,"According to a new study, it's estimated that 10 to 27 percent of noncitizens currently living in the United States have voter registration.","0. This claim is false. While there have been studies on noncitizen voting, no credible research has found such high registration rates.

Multiple studies, including research by the Brennan Center for Justice, have found that voter registration by non-citizens is exceedingly rare, with rates far below 1%.

1417,0,A newly released report indicates that 10 to 27% of non-citizens in America have registered to vote.,"0. This claim is false and stems from a misrepresentation of a disputed 2014 study by Richman et al. Subsequent research and fact-checking by multiple organizations have debunked these figures. The actual rate of non-citizen registration is negligible, with very few verified cases of non-citizen voting in U.S. elections."
1418,0,Findings from a fresh study show that anywhere from 10% to 27% of non-citizens in the U.S. are listed as registered voters.,"0. This claim appears to be false.
