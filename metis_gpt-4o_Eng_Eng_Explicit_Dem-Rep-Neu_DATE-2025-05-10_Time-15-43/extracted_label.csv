These areas, traditionally Republican strongholds, showed decreased support for Donald Trump compared to previous Republican candidates.

286,0,'143 Democrats' Voted in Favor of Letting Noncitizens Vote in US Elections?,"0. Reasoning Explanation: The claim is misleading. In February 2022, House Republicans proposed an amendment to a voting rights bill to affirm that only U.S. citizens should vote in federal elections. The amendment was defeated 218-210, with some Democrats opposing the amendment based on procedural grounds or the belief it was redundant, not because they supported noncitizen voting. The opposition was not a vote in favor of noncitizen voting. Confidence: 90%"
286,0,'143 Democrats' Voted in Favor of Letting Noncitizens Vote in US Elections?,"0. Reasoning Explanation: The claim is misleading. In 2019, a House amendment to H.R. 1 opposed noncitizen voting in federal elections. However, it did not directly allow noncitizens to vote. The 143 Democrats who voted against the amendment likely opposed it on procedural or jurisdictional grounds, not because they supported noncitizen voting in federal elections. Confidence: 85%"
286,0,'143 Democrats' Voted in Favor of Letting Noncitizens Vote in US Elections?,"0. The claim that '143 Democrats' voted in favor of letting noncitizens vote in US elections is misleading. The vote was on a Washington, D.C. law allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections, not federal ones. The House of Representatives passed a resolution disapproving this local law, but this was not a vote on allowing noncitizens to vote in federal elections. Thus, it's inaccurate to say Democrats voted to let noncitizens vote in US elections broadly. Source"
